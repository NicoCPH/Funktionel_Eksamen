**1  Functions**

 

Explain in your own words with code examples in Elm and Haskell:



**• Functions as ﬁrst class citizens** 
 Means that you can pass functions anywhere as if its a variable. 



 **• higher order functions** 
 Means that it does atleast one of the following, takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result



**• lambdas** 
 Lamdas is under the category anonymous functions witch means its a function without a name.

In haskel it looks like this:

\arguments -> returnedValue

and in elm:
 \arguments -> returnedValue
